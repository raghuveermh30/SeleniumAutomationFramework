Retry logic is implemented in the TestNG
Suppose the test will be failed in any UI automation, it will try to execute the test cases again based on the maximum count

IRetryAnalyser --> We need to override the method that is present in Retry class

suppose, if the first attempt is Passed, then Retry logic won;t be triggered.
If the test case is failed --> Test case will retry again upto 3 times -> In any of the iterations, test case will be passed then it
will be considered as Pass
In any of the iterations, test case will be FAILED then it will be considered as Fail

Log4J Dependency
Add the resources directory in the src/main/java
Log.info is faster than System.out.println
Log.info will be displayed in the timestamp
This is very popular library -> Dev's will also use the Log4J api;s

There are 4 stages of Logger --> Info, Error, Warn, Debug
